       <h2>My Story</h2>
       
       <p>
            Aidan started as Mechanical Engineer at UMass Lowell, until he took a writing course which catalyzed his switch to an English major. As part of the change, he transferred to UMass Amherst, where he balances his studies between literature, both historical and contemporary, and creative writing, typically fiction. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Currently, Aidan participates in writing workshops where he improves his narrative writing and editing capabilities with his fellow peers. He is also a writing intern for Catalyst Planet, a travel/global events newsletter which focuses on cultures, places, and people often overlooked or underdiscussed.
