            <h1>How to Race the 800m Dash</h1>
            <p>
                The 800m—a distance that sits in an excrutiating gray area of speed and endurance—is notorious for being one of the most difficult races in the sport of track. Here, I'll cover the basics of training strategies so that you are ready for race day. Whether you are a current athlete or entirely new to track, the information here is meant to serve as ample preparation for this infamous race distance.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Training</h2>
            <p>There are three type of 800m runners. It's ok if you aren't sure which one you are now—it will become self-evident as you train.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Speed dominant (400/800m Runner)</strong>
                    <br>
                    Your body relies on raw sprint speed to get out hard during your race. Top-end speed and strength are your strongsuits. You might fade in the end, but your first lap can break opponents will.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Endurance dominant (1500/800m Runner)</strong>
                    <br>
                    Unlike the sprinter, you rely on your endurance to perform well in the 800m. Your VO2 max are high and you tend to stick to a single pace during your race. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pure 800m Runner</strong>
                    <br>
                    Your body lies in a balance between sprint speed and endurance captabillity. You go out hard and finish strong. You are an ideal 800m runner, but training strategies for you can be trickier to master. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Protocal</h2>
            <p>Now that you've determined which type of runner you are, its time to set-up a training protocal.
            </p> 
            <strong>Important Note: Before attempting any protocal, make sure you have built up a base mileage of at least 20 miles. This important for avoiding injuries and making sure your body is ready to handle weeks of strenuous training. 
            </strong>
            <p>
            Any track race is about optimizing YOUR body for the race. If you are an endurance runner, there is little use (and often damage) in attempting to force yourself into becoming a speed-based runner. With this in mind, optimizing for the 800m becomes tricker than other races, because it utilizes ~50% anaerobic & ~50 aerobic, which are the two main power systems of the body during a race.
            </p>
            <p>
                To put it simply, the 800m is different than other races because there are certain body systems you MUST train to some extent. A speed based 800m runner WILL focus on their sprinting speed and power, but, this DOES NOT exclude them from training their endurance from time to time. Track is about optimizing your body for your race—and that means building on your strengths and patching your weaknesses. What this means in the context of the 800m is that you need to try and strengthen both your speed and endruance systems simultaneaously, without gurantee of achieving a 100% balance. 
            </p>
            <p>
               With those notes out of the way, here is a sample protocal (based around a PURE 800m runner) with advice on progression. Just remember that consistinecy and focusing on your strengths are almost always more important than trying to cultivate a perfect workout. Actually getting outside and running is more productive than endless optimization (I speak from personal experience here).

                <li>1000m x 6 @75% effort, 2 min rest</li>
                <li>Gym work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Sunday</strong>
                <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rest Day!</li>
                <li>Yes, a rest day. Do not go out and push yourself, your body needs a day to heal. Gym work and stretching is okay, but no running or leg strength work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For speed atheltes, try and do 1-2 speed workouts a week, and one endurance workout every other week. For pure try and keep it balanced as shown in the example. And for endurance runners, include speed every other week and focus on middle-long distance workouts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of progression, you can do as you chose:
            </p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Increase interval distance (500m reps --- 600m reps) This is great for gettiing work on at threshold paces</li>
                <li>Decrease rest (2 min --- 1.5 min rest) This is great for increasing VO2 max and endurance</li>
                <li>Increase intensity (70% effort --- 80% effort) This is best for later in the season, when you are at your peak and pushinig your body to its limits</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Note: Only increase one of these at a time. Doing too many at once can completely change the workout</strong>
