               I chose this image because it was a photo I took during my time in Rhiwlas, a small village in Wales. It was this trip that influenced my shift into travel writing which has lead to my internship with Catalyst Planet.

                This is a photo of Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa, the tallest mountain in Wales. It was one of the most beautiful, scenic hikes I have ever completed, and there were many memorable people and moments along the way. It has also influenced a lot of my writing in terms of setting.

                While studying abroad in Oxford, I had access to the Bodleian Library system, a rare privilage which I may never have again. This photo shows The Radcliffe Camera, which was one of my favorite study spots. I may inlcude this photo on my website for anything relating to my experience while in England.
